                <h3>Dungeons and Dragon Spell Sheet</h3>
                <p>This is a React app that allows you to browse through 5th edition spells and create a list of your spells for the day</p>

                <h3>Receipt Tracker</h3>
                <p>This React app was built as a group build with fellow Lambda Students. Justin Gent did a fantastic job with the backend and everything on the front end is my work.</p>

                <h3>Salty Hacker News Trolls</h3>
                <p>This was the first React build week project I worked on. Tony Kovar and I built out the front end. My contributions include the forms, routing (except private routes done by Tony), and the comments layout. As well as all the styling (with some input and colloboration from Tony), yes even that tiny animated salt shaker.</p>

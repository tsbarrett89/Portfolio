            <h1>Thomas Barrett</h1>
            <p>I am a full stack web development student with Lambda School. I moved to beautiful Missoula, MT 12 years ago to attend the University of Montana and earned a B.A. in History in 2012. My rather vague and unfocused plans in life receieved a sudden, but joyous, shock when I found out I would be a father before I finished my degree. Since graduation I have struggled to balance my life's desires with the realities of raising a family. With web development I am quite grateful to finally find a path that is challenging yet enjoyable, but will also allow me to fully support my family.</p>
            <p>Most of my web development experience comes through React, and the html, css, and javascript that enable it. I am also familar with vanilla javascript and work everyday to improve that skill more than anything else. I just finished my third unit with Lambda School and I look forward to learning node.js in my next unit.</p>
            <p>When I am not learning web development my time is mostly spent with my family. I love to play D&D with friends and my oldest son (I'm sure his siblings will join when they want to). I enjoy playing a variety of video games, mostly in the fantasy RPG genre, and my guilty pleasure is League of Legends.</p>
